# Image Processing Toolbox

This repo contains programs of image processing of opencv.
To compile and execute this c++ image processing programs you must install and setup the opencv and make environment for development of the opencv programs.
You can compile and execute this programs in two ways by Visual Studio or through command line.
After setting up the environment for opencv you have to setup the environment variables for the opencv directories otherwise the code will not work.
To compile and execute you can use command line code to compile or through visual studio build method.
There are two image processing functions in this repo.
First is multithresh function to multithresh the input image.
Second is imquantize function to imquantize the input image.

Hope you find it helpful.
Thank you.
